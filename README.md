# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Image Classifier with ResNet50

This project uses transfer learning with ResNet50 to classify breast cancer subtypes from histopathology images.

## ðŸ’¡ Overview
- **Goal**: Multi-class classification of breast cancer subtypes
- **Data**: BreakHis dataset (benign vs malignant + subtypes)
- **Model**: ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet
- **Tools**: PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy

## ðŸ”¬ Method
1. Preprocessed `.npy` histopathology images
2. Fine-tuned `ResNet50` with new classification head
3. Used learning rate scheduler, early stopping, data augmentation and class weights
4. Evaluated with F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC

## ðŸ§ª Final Test Set Performance

This model was evaluated on a held-out test set after hyperparameter tuning and early stopping.  
Performance metrics were computed from the final confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve.

| Metric     | Value     |
|------------|-----------|
| Accuracy   | **95.18%** |
| Precision  | **98.14%** |
| Recall     | **95.26%** |
| F1 Score   | **96.68%** |
| AUC        | **95.11%** |
